# About iRoseTime

Time moves differently at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.  Perhaps that's because it's surrounded by Indiana?  Anyway, iRoseTime will help you stay reasonably sane despite the incessant ringing of the bells.

iRoseTime is an iOS application for various time-tracking tasks at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.  In its current form, the app tracks the current time of day at Rose and counts down the minutes and seconds until the next class bell.  The app displays the time and class periods with a Rose-appropriate sliderule interface.

Planned enhancements:

- countdown to next bell using some additional Rose-appropriate device; micrometer, anyone?

- improved background images; current image is from [Stephen Gregory's Flickr page] [1]

- highlight which periods of the day you have class

- interface with Banner schedule lookup

- display class schedules for members of a project team

- display the academic calendar (breaks, add/drop deadlines, etc.)

iRoseTime currently is designed as an iPhone-only application.  Someday iPad support might be nice, but I agree with Kent Beck that small iterations and early releases are important.  So, iPad support will wait.

## Installing iRoseTime

Eventually, I'll post iRoseTime to the App Store.  For now, the only way to install it is if you have a developer account that allows you to install software from Xcode to your device.  Pull the code to your machine, open iRoseTime.xcodeproj in Xcode, and install it on your device like you would any software that you're developing.


## What's all this about Bells?

For the uninitiated, Rose runs on 50 minute class periods with 5 minute passing periods.  Five minutes is barely long enough, so we have bells that ring to signal the start and end of each period.  Can't have us boring professors droning on past our allotted 50 minutes.
